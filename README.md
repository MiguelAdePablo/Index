# ![](./Images/Github.png) &nbsp;&nbsp;    Index 📦 Central repository

This repository acts as the main entry point to all my GitHub projects. From here you can easily navigate to the index repositories organized by category.

The goal is to keep a clear and scalable structure, where each category groups related repositories.

  - This repository does not contain code, only documentation and links.
